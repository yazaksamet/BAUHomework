# kmeans
Source code is a eclipse java project. To run the implementation, you should start AppMain.java in eclipse. After the execution is done, program will create two files under output folder. One for centroid data, one for iris data with cluster information. These two files are used to plot 3d figures in R. To plot 3d figures, you can find R script plot.R in output folder. There are also 4 3d plot images that plotted with this script of iris data. If you want to plot it yourself, you should uncomment the first line of the R script. That line will install 'scatterplot3d' library to enable you plot 3d figures. If it is already installed, you can skip it.
